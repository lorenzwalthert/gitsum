# Introduction
This package parses a git repository history to collect 
comprehensive information about the activity in the repo. The parsed 
data is made available to the user in a tabular format. The package can also 
generate reports based on the parse data. You can install the development 
version from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("lorenzwalthert/gitsum")
```

There are two main functions for parsing the history, both return tabular data: 

* `parse_log_simple()` is a relatively fast parser and returns a tibble with 
  one commit per row. There is no file-specific information.
* `parse_log_detailed()` outputs a nested tibble and for each commit, the names
  of the amended files, number of lines changed ect. available. This function
  is slower.

`report_git()` creates a html, pdf, or word report with the parsed log data 
according to a template. Templates can be created by the user or a template 
from the `gitsum` package can be used.

Let's see the package in action.
  
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("gitsum")
library("tidyverse")
library("forcats")
```

We can obtain a parsed log like this:

```{r}
tbl <- parse_log_detailed() %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  select(short_hash, short_message, total_files_changed, nested)
tbl 
```

Since we used `parse_log_detailed()`, there is detailed file-specific
information available for every commit:

```{r}
tbl$nested[[3]]
```

Since the data has such a high resolution, various graphs, tables etc. can be 
produced from it to provide insights into the git history.

# Examples
Since the output of `git_log_detailed()` is a nested tibble, you can work on it 
as you work on any other tibble.
Let us first have a look at who comitted to this repository:
```{r}
log <- parse_log_detailed()
log %>%
group_by(author_name) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

We can also investigate how the number of lines of each file in the R 
directory evolved. For that, we probaly want to view files with changed names
as one file. Also, we probably don't want to see boring plots for files that 
got changed only a few times. Let's focus on files that were changed in 
at least five commits.
```{r per_file, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lines <- log %>%
  unnest() %>%
  set_changed_file_to_latest_name() %>%
  add_line_history()

r_files <- grep("^R/", lines$changed_file, value = TRUE)

to_plot <- lines %>%
  filter(changed_file %in% r_files) %>%
  add_n_times_changed_file() %>%
  filter(n_times_changed_file >= 5)
ggplot(to_plot, aes(x = date, y = current_lines)) + 
  geom_step() + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of Lines", limits = c(0, NA)) + 
  facet_wrap(~changed_file, scales = "free_y")
```


Next, we want to see which files were contained in most commits:
```{r ggplot1}
log %>%
  unnest(nested) %>% # unnest the tibble
  mutate(changed_file = fct_lump(fct_infreq(changed_file), n = 10)) %>%
  filter(changed_file != "Other") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = changed_file)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal()
```

We can also easily get a visual overview of the number of insertions & deletions in commits over time:
```{r ggplot2}
commit.dat <- data.frame(
    edits = rep(c("Insertions", "Deletions"), each = nrow(log)),
    commit = rep(1:nrow(log), 2),
    count = c(log$total_insertions, -log$total_deletions))
    
ggplot(commit.dat, aes(x = commit, y = count, fill = edits)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "identity") +  
  theme_minimal()
```

Or the number of commits broken down by day of the week:
```{r ggplot3}
log %>%
  mutate(weekday = factor(weekday, c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday)) + geom_bar() + 
  theme_minimal()
```
