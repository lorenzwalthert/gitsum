\title{Detect whether a \code{changed_file}-entry is a renaming}
\usage{
is_name_change(changed_file, reassignment_pattern = ".+\\\\s\\\\=\\\\>.+$")
}
\arguments{
\item{changed_file}{The column \code{changed_file} from a parsed unnested
detailed log as a vector.}

\item{reassignment_pattern}{The regular expression pattern that corresponds
to renaming.}
}
\description{
Filenames in \code{$ git log} containing the sequence \code{=>} are viewed as renamed
files. There seems no other way around that, so this function will indicate
a file is a name change even if it may not be the case.
}
\examples{
gitsum:::is_name_change(c(
  "R/{gitsum.R => gitsum-package.R}", "API => API2",
  "this is jus a file with => in it, it's not a name change"
))
}
