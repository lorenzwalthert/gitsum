\title{Set the column  \code{changed_files} of a \code{log} to the latest name of the file}
\usage{
set_changed_file_to_latest_name(log)
}
\arguments{
\item{log}{An unnested detailed log.}
}
\description{
\code{\link[=parse_log_detailed]{parse_log_detailed()}} parses a git log. However, changed file names
are not corrected retroactively. Hence, if one wants to process file-specific
commit data for one file across different names for that file, the column
\code{changed_files} has to be unified. This is done with this function by
updating the file names recursively and setting them to the latest name used.
Filenames containing the sequence \code{=>} are viewed as renamed files, so
there will likely be problems when you apply this function to a git
repository that contains (or contained) files with such files names. You
may have to update the column \code{changed_file} manually.
